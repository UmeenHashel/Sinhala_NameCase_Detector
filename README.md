# Sinhala Name Case Detector

A machine learning-based web application to detect and identify the name case in a given Sinhala sentence. This project showcases my research on using machine learning for natural language processing (NLP) tasks in the Sinhala language.

## Introduction
This project is a web application that uses machine learning to detect the name case in a Sinhala sentence. It is designed to demonstrate the application of NLP techniques for low-resource languages like Sinhala. The backend is powered by Flask, while the frontend is built using HTML and CSS.

## Features
- **Name Case Detection**: Identifies the name case in a given Sinhala sentence.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive web interface for input and output.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a trained model to predict the name case.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Provides instant results based on user input.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or any other framework used
- **Other Tools**: Git, GitHub, Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, etc.)
